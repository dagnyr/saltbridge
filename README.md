# saltbridge 🧂

## Overview  
This project aims to identify and characterise salt bridges in T-cell receptors (TCRs) to understand how they contribute to TCR structure, stability, and antigen recognition. Salt bridges—electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged amino acids—are common features in protein structures and in protein-protein interactions, including in TCR-pMHC interactions.
